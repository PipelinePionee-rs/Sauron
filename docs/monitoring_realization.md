We didn't find nay major realization from our monitoring. 
There are probably multiple factors for this.
One of which is our limited telemetry in total http requests , and latency.
More telemetry might have exposed some unknown issues.

Another factor is that our server is pretty beefy,
and therefor any performance related telemetry was not really a factor.

That being said, we can definitely see the power and purpose especially for
larger projects, and software in production, where uptime and discovering problems early is key.

Our key takeaways is that more relevant telemetry could have exposed more issues.
That monitoring is more relevant for a larger project, but still great for any software in production.
