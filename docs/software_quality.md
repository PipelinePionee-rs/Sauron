codeclimate only found issues in the legacy code.

deepsource found some issues regarding missing documentation, but we generally find the code to be self-documenting.
other issues were only of minor importance, such as unused variables or or console.log statements.
fixing these issues is not a priority, but we should probably address them at some point.

SonarQube found some issues with our Dockerfile, like copying recursively (COPY . .), which we looked into, and deemed to be a non-issue.

Overall, the codebase seems to be in good shape, with no major issues found.
