# How We Are DevOps: Sauron Search Engine Project

In our search engine project, we've embraced DevOps principles throughout our development process, transforming the whoknows_variations searchengine codebase into a modern Rust implementation while maintaining our JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend.

Firstly, we've chosen to frame our "How are you DevOps?" assignment through the CALMS framework because it provides a comprehensive lens that goes beyond technical practices alone. While tooling and automation are important aspects of DevOps, we recognize that successful DevOps implementation fundamentally requires cultural and organizational transformation.
However, we are not DevOps - But we have stayed committed to the elective and its learning goals - and endeavoured on a journey of continuous learning. 

## Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing (CALMS)

*Culture*
Our team has cultivated DevOps culture based on psychological safety. We encourage open communication, where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas, raising concerns, and making mistakes. This has fostered an environment of continuous learning and innovation, where we support and help each other rather than assigning blame. Our regular meetings allow us to reflect on our processes and implement improvements collaboratively. 

*Automation*
We've implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which has significantly improved our development workflow. Our automated workflows run tests on every pull request and on code pushes to the dev and main branches, ensuring we catch issues early in the development cycle. After successful builds, our system automatically deploys to our production environment, reducing manual intervention and potential human error.

*Lean*
We've adopted lean principles by focusing on delivering value continuously in small increments. By working in short iterations and getting rapid feedback, we minimize waste and optimize our workflow. Our migration from Python to Rust demonstrates our commitment to eliminating technical debt and building more efficient systems that deliver better performance for our users.

*Measurement*
We've implemented structured logging in our Rust backend to improve our operational visibility. Our website integrates with a simulation provided by our lecturer, which allows us to view logs and monitor system behavior, and act on potential issues fast. We also use Postman for health checks and track KPIs on the server, giving us insights into uptime and performance. These tools help us detect issues early, validate our changes, and make more informed decisions during development.

*Sharing*
Knowledge sharing is a core part of our process. While we havenâ€™t practiced pair programming, we hold regular online meetings where team members actively support each other by discussing challenges, sharing insights, and offering help. These online meetings are held on discord, on a channel exclusively for our group in the DevOps elective. This channel is a lively space, where teammembers share struggles and victories - and mostly, a safe space where we support each other through challenges and celebrate successes. 
Although our README and documentation are still evolving, they provide a starting point for understanding the project and contributing to the codebase. 
These collaborative practices have fostered open communication and strengthened the connection between team members, supporting a culture of continuous learning.

##Improvements
While we have made significant strides in adopting DevOps principles, there are several areas where we can further enhance our practices to become more efficient and effective. One key issue is communication. Team members need to improve their openness and the frequency of check-ins. As our team consists of individuals with varying levels of knowledge and experience, implementing pair programming or, at a minimum, increasing the sharing of progress on each assignment would be beneficial. This will foster a more collaborative environment and ensure that everyone is aligned and supported in their tasks.
